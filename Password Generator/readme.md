We start by importing the random and string modules, which are required for generating random passwords.

The generate_password() function takes a parameter length that represents the desired password length. Inside the function, we define a variable characters that contains all the possible characters that can be included in the password. This includes lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, and punctuation marks.

We use a list comprehension and the random.choice() function to randomly select characters from the characters string. We repeat this process length times to generate a password of the desired length.

The generated password is returned by the generate_password() function.

The main() function is responsible for handling user input. It prompts the user to enter the desired password length using the input() function. We use int() to convert the user input to an integer.

We use a try-except block to handle potential errors. If the user enters an invalid input (e.g., a non-integer or a negative number), an error message is displayed.

If the user input is valid, we call the generate_password() function with the password length as an argument. The generated password is stored in the generated_password variable.

We display the generated password using the print() function. We also print the password without any additional text for easier copying.
