In this code, the four arithmetic functions (add, subtract, multiply, divide) are defined using the def keyword. Each function takes two arguments (x and y) and returns the result of the corresponding arithmetic operation.

The code then prompts the user to enter two numbers (num1 and num2) and the desired operation (operator). The user's input is converted to floating-point numbers using the float function.

Next, the code uses conditional statements (if, elif, else) to determine which arithmetic operation to perform based on the value of operator. The corresponding arithmetic function is called with num1 and num2 as arguments, and the result is stored in the result variable.

If the user enters an invalid operator, an error message is assigned to the result variable.

Finally, the result is displayed to the user using the print function.
